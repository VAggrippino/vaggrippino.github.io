        The world is a vampire
        Sent to drain
        Secret destroyers
        Hold you up to the flames
        And what do I get
        For my pain?
        Betrayed desires
        And a piece of the game

        Even though I know
        I suppose I'll show
        All my cool and cold
        Like ol' Job</blockquote>
