 I’m losing my momentum. That *new project* enthusiasm is gone and I’m faced with distraction and doubt. What do I do? Choose an easier alternative? Prepare more before continuing? Or push forward at a unique and considerable risk?

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">The greatest barrier to my employment right now is the lack of a good portfolio. With this in mind, I put together a list of projects to build that I think will demonstrate the full range of my skills… Copies of existing sites with unique modifications… Re-creations of old sites with my own perspective on how they should be built today… And, some original ideas. These are all high-quality, broadly scoped projects targeting real use cases. They are *not* quick one or two day jobs.

About three weeks ago, I chose one from the list and started work. Now I’m at a critical stage. There are, of course, implementation challenges, but that was expected. The problem is that it’s not a new project any more. I’m fixing bugs more than I’m adding features and I’m caught under the avalanche of minutiae of making it *just right*. It has become a grind: *feature… bug… bug… bug… feature… bug… bug…* and so on. I’m tired. I don’t look forward to working on it any more. I find my mind wandering. I’m prone to distraction and doubt. Seemingly on it’s own, My mind is tempting me with alternatives… *Maybe I should work on my résumé instead.* … *Maybe I should work on my blog instead.* … *Maybe I should do some Upwork projects instead.* … *Maybe I should read more about creating a portfolio first.* …

*This* is a critical time. I know all too well that this happens in any project that takes more than a couple of days to finish.

Admittedly, my mental stamina is quite low. It’s my own fault, but at the same time I feel like it was completely out of my control.

For several years after I got out of the Army, I coasted. I did quite well for myself. I had no focus at all, but I had endless energy and boundless enthusiasm. Then I got sick. My energy disappeared and my enthusiasm turned to fear. My constant worry that I would trigger another *episode* taught me to *back off* whenever I felt stress. I got very good at *backing off* and lost the ability to *follow through*.

Then, my daughter started speaking and dreaming and wanting things beyond simple candy and toys. She has dreams and goals of her own now. What kind of example do I set if I stop working whenever my initial enthusiasm wears off. What kind of parent am I if I don’t earn an income to provide her with a decent education or an environment where her imagination can flourish and she can achieve her goals?

No! I will not *back off*! This is the mental equivalent of [muscle failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_to_failure) and I must push in order to grow. This is an essential trial and I must not fail if I want to … be a person again.
