Today I dusted off the blog: [aggrippino.com](https://www.aggrippino.com/):

- Updated WordPress.
- Fixed file permissions on the web host.
- Deleted/updated/installed some plugins.
- Deleted/updated some themes. Installed a new theme (OnePress).
- Tried the WP Dark Mode plugin, but deactivated it due to conflicts with theme and extensions.
- Installed SyntaxHighlighter Evolved plugin.
- Made modifications to some CSS and some images to work with the new theme
- Installed UpdraftPlus for automatic backups to GDrive.
- Tried to set up Adsense, but it was a No Go… They won’t let me put in American payment information from a Malaysian IP address.
- Started to check out Hashnode as a possible alternative
