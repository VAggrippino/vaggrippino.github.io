In terms of actually sitting in front of the computer and coding, it was a light day today. Some essential, but unfortunately timed, medical appointments clashed with my US EST work schedule, but I was still able to review some materials from [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) while on the road and I did a little bit of coding after recovering from lost sleep. I experimented a little with React props and nested components.
