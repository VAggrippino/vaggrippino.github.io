                <em>I</em> feel like "self affirmation" is nonsense and telling myself blatant lies makes me feel worse about myself, not better. However, scientific research has shown in many cases that it has a generally positive effect.

### Lesson 1

Well, it was lesson one for me anyway...

I joined the US Army in 1992. Fourteen weeks in, I had completed <abbr title="Advanced Individual Training">AIT</abbr> and I was ready to head to my first duty station. Upon completion of the training, our instructor told my class that we were the best group he had seen. Although I had had some difficulty, I made it through. So, I believed what the instructor told us and I was beaming with pride. We all were.

I was naive...

Trainees were split into two groups. There was a morning session and an afternoon session. My group was in the afternoon session, but we all had the same instructors and the same training. During that last week when we were all waiting for our first duty assignment, I had a conversation with one of the members of the morning group and he proudly told me that the instructor told his group that they were the best group he had seen. When I told him that the instructor told us the same thing he was angry... at me?! He was absolutely convinced that his group was the best. He hated me ever after that, which was fine because we both went to our duty stations a few days later and never saw each other again.

Now, I've always been naive and I've often been a bit slow on the uptake, but I've never been stupid. So, when I heard that the instructor gave both groups the same praise, I instantly knew what was going on. He was manipulating us to get a certain response. And it worked... on everybody but me.

### Lesson 2 - Over 30 Years Later

So what? Was that guy stupid and I was so much smarter? Well, I can tell you this: he was _normal_ and I was odd. Most people happily went along with what they were told and they thrived because of it. They weren't _necessarily_ fooled by it. They just made the best of the situation. I, on the other hand, carried the bitterness of being constantly lied to and manipulated throughout my entire time in service.

Truth be told, I've carried this mentality with me my entire life. And I've suffered because of it. It's taken me this long to realize it.

### Lesson 3 - Impostor Impostor

The buzzworthy "Impostor Syndrome" inspired me to start writing this. I _want to_ tell you what _I_ see when an "influencer" talks about it and what _I_ think about your doubts, and my own... It's _The Truthâ„¢_ ... Isn't it? Well... yeah! ... If you could put everything on a scale and weigh it, or add it up on a calculator, it's absolutely the truth. But...

There's another _truth_ at work here, though. If you doubt yourself, then someone convinces you your doubts aren't well founded, you'll do better. Whether it's because you work harder, create more, or just keep going when you might've quit, you'll do better because you believe your efforts are worthwhile.

I'm still _odd_. I weigh and calculate everything. I don't trust others because I see the grift. I don't doubt my doubts because I've measured every iota of my work. When someone gives me praise, I doubt their sincerity or their judgement. I can't enjoy a scary movie because I know how the effects are done. And I can't even enjoy human interaction. Ever.

I've seen _[the man behind the curtain](https://youtu.be/-RQxD4Ff7dY?si=mwkM1_PojL8iL0IX)_, but he had no gifts for me. Don't be like me.
