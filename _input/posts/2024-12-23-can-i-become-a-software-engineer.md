            "Code Monkey" is supposed to be a pejorative term, but I dunno... A
            simple-minded creature who has learned to do something he enjoys and
            is able to sustain himself by doing it... That sounds like a pretty
            good life to me.

This is about me. You might believe that _anyone_ can become a Software Engineer, but I'm asking you to consider a different context. I'm facing interesting challenges, some of which are truly unique.

I used to think I could do whatever I set my mind to. It was mostly true, but there are some definite exceptions. For example, I could never have become a professional athlete. No matter how hard I trained I'd always be competing against people who were training just as hard but had innate talents I just didn't have.


## What _is_ a Software Engineer?
For this discussion, a Software Engineer is an individual who is employed and financially compensated to create software which either supports or implements a product or service. There are other definitions, but this is the one I'm going with right now.

I'm not talking about an ecosystem, activity, philosophy, culture, or way of life that might also be referred to as a Software Engineer. I'm talking about **getting a job**.


## Network!
The most important skill and activity _right now_ for getting a job is networking. Building a professional network is as an essential factor of any job search. In some employment discussions, they even say that networking is more important than job skills.

This presents a bit of a conundrum for me because I have a personality disorder (read more about it: [_My_ Schizoid Personality Disorder](/2024/12/my-schizoid-personality-disorder)). This makes networking very difficult for me, if not impossible. Like the professional athlete, most people have innate social talents I just don't have. I have the same tools, but I have no hope of using them as effectively as my rivals.

Having said that, I _can_ form professional relationships with people. I just really like talking about solving problems and writing code. I'm not interested in hobbies or interests, even if they're similar to mine, and I'd rather not know about social / political / religious beliefs.


## Job Skills
The importance of social vs technical skills may be debatable, but technical skills _are_ still important. Fortunately, I've got a pretty good skillset.

Windows, Linux, Unix (SCO, AIX, or Solaris), Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, Perl, PHP, NodeJS, Deno, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, Google Cloud Platform.

My proficiency in each of these is a separate discussion, but I've genuinely worked with all of these.

### Portfolio
I don't really have a portfolio demonstrating these skills. Or, I suppose you could say I have a very disorganized portfolio presenting hundreds of projects that vary greatly in size, scope, and stage of completion.

I'd like to be convinced that building a beautiful portfolio will help me in some way. Lately, though, it seems that anything I might try to do would be insignificant next to the efforts of the hordes of full-time technical "content creators". Playing around with new technologies and techniques to learn new stuff is more fun than polishing old projects for no benefit.


## Remote Only
I was born and raised in the United States, but I live in Malaysia. Local immigration laws and a disadvantageous political situation prevent me from working locally. I can't even work freelance for local clients. I can't open a bank account and, even if I could, I couldn't receive a paycheck because "Any form of employment is strictly prohibited" (stamped on my pass).

I have an American bank account and I'm still required to pay US taxes for any income.

Upwork, Adsense, PayPal and many other online earning resources are not accessible to me because my location and my bank's location don't match.

So, I can only work remotely for an American employer.


## Health
Physically, I suffer from chronic pain and a minor disability. I also struggle with insomnia. I may be a little slower than I used to be and my stamina isn't what it was, either, but I can still produce 40 hours of high-quality work per week.

That should be enough. I wouldn't expect an employer to make any special accommodations for me. That wouldn't be needed, but I know there are others who can do the same job as me faster and for 40-60 hours per week.


## The State of Employment
The job market has been negatively affected by a number of factors that are difficult to confirm or quantify. We all feel it and most people will acknowledge that it's a tough job market.

There are some contentious points here, but they represent sincere concerns held by people involved in different aspects of the employment process:

- Competition: Every job has hundreds of applicants; [Discussion at Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Community/job-hunting-in-tech/over-100-applicants-on-almost-every-role-whats-up-with-every-job-posting-having-over-100-applicants-in-just-a-few-hours)
- Fake jobs: A third of job postings are "ghost jobs"; [Article at Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/08/13/36-of-job-adverts-are-fake-how-to-spot-them-in-2024/)
- Unfair biases: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies often result in gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation being used as factors in hiring decisions; [Related Discusson on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/15et0fb/i_cant_fill_positions_because_of_dei/)
- Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS): Virtually all employers and recruiters use ATS to filter out <em>un</em>qualified candidates, but most qualified candidates are filtered out, too. According to a study by Harvard Business School, over 90% of middle skills and high skills candidates are filtered out by ATS: This is a PDF file: [Hidden Workers: Untapped Talent](https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/research/hiddenworkers09032021.pdf)


## Money
I don't care about money. Seriously! Too many people are caught up in the legend of the high six-figure Software Engineer salary, but I really just want to work and feel like my work is appreciated.

You might think that gives me an advantage. After all, I can undercut anyone's price. But employers often evaluate you based on your asking price. If it's too low, they think you're not worth hiring at all. And recruiters' commission is based on starting salary, too. So, they want the candidate with the highest salary request to succeed.

Naturally, I want to get paid as much as I deserve, but I don't know how much that is. I'd work for minimum wage. For me it's about doing satisfying work. I like programming and I hate the petty manipulations on both sides of the hiring process.


## The Answer ...?
What's the answer? Can I get a job as a Software Engineer? Well, yeah! ... theoretically... I'm sure there are American companies with open fully remote Software Engineering jobs that I can do well. But, can I overcome my social ineptitude, the ATS, and present myself as the best candidate among hundreds? ... That I'm not so sure about.
