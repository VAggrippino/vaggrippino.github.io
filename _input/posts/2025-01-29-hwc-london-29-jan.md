I'll be attending the Homebrew Website Club meeting for the Europe/London time zone on January 29th.

I'm looking forward to talking about my progress with Webmention implementation on my own site as well as some mistakes I've made.

If there's time and interest, I might also ask for feedback and opinions about employment opportunities in Web Development.
