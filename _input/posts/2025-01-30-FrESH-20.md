I'll be attending today's Front End Study Hall meeting online.

I think I saw a thread in the IndieWeb chat about someone who was working on an interesting problem and wanted to discuss it in the FrESH meetup. I love interesting problems 😁

Besides that, I've neglected the design of my own site and I'm going to change that soon. Maybe I can get some ideas from others.
