I'm looking forward to attending the online Homebrew Website Club meetup for February 4th.

Our host, Sara Jak≈°a, is a software developer from Ljubljana. I think I would really enjoy attending one of her Python presentations, but today's conversation will be about writing on the web.

I read and watch a lot of programming content but I often struggle with writing and other forms of content creation online. So, I'll be paying close attention.
