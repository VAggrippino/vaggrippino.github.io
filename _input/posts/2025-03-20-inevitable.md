I've tried to _fit in_ countless times. I have my work, my hobbies, and my other interests. It stands to reason that there should be several groups I can fit into and be an active member of. Well, _reason_ doesn't stand here. I **don't** _fit in_. There's a course that my life has followed during every social interaction. It is inevitable...

## Unicorns and Rainbows
I encounter a group that seems to have goals or interests aligned to my own. The members of the group are welcoming and encouraging.

## Engagement
I start to feel like I have peers. It's a feeling that has been absent from most of my life, so it's a pretty special feeling. I want to help the group reach it's goals or otherwise advance its mission. I get nothing but encouragement. Often, they actively solicit my participation.

## Downfall
There is a misunderstanding. Or, I say something inappropriate. To be clear [it _is_ my fault](https://aggrippino.com/2024/12/my-schizoid-personality-disorder/). I don't mean to offend anybody, but it doesn't matter. Explanations don't diminish the impact once a negative impression is made and people don't forgive offenses as easily as you might think.

## Aftermath
I am ejected from the organization, often insulted, and blacklisted. There was a time when I would have defiantly proclaimed that _I don't need them!_, or _That's just not my people. I'll find where I fit in._ Well, now I know better.

This. Is. Inevitable.
