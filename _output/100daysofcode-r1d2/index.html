<p>In terms of actually sitting in front of the computer and coding, it was a light day today. Some essential, but unfortunately timed, medical appointments clashed with my US EST work schedule, but I was still able to review some materials from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/">Modern React with Redux</a> while on the road and I did a little bit of coding after recovering from lost sleep. I experimented a little with React props and nested components.</p>
