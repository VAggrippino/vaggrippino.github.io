<p><em><s>New Year's Resolution</s> A few ideas for 2024</em></p>
<p>Whether it's at the beginning of a year or at any other time, the concept of a <em>resolution</em> is ridiculous. You know you're gonna fail. Failure is built into the idea. It's just a question of <em>when?</em> It's become a meme. Don't do that to yourself.</p>
<p>Sure, some people keep their resolutions. But those people are abnormal.</p>
<p>Well, I don't know a solution, but I would like to do things a little differently in the near future.</p>
<p>So, here are a few ideas to help you head in the right direction...</p>
<h3>Learn, Build, Teach</h3>
<h4>Learn</h4>
<p>Pick a small topic from YouTube, an article, or social media and learn it.</p>
<h4>Build</h4>
<p>Create something that uses the new <em>thing</em> that you've learned.</p>
<h4>Teach</h4>
<p>In an article or video explain in detail what you built and how you built it.</p>
<h3>Blog</h3>
<p>This blog needs to be finished and made fully functional. Every article should be here and every YouTube video should be be associated with an article here. Even social media posts should mostly start their lives here.</p>
<h3>YouTube</h3>
<p>You like watching YouTube videos, don't you? Why not create them? It'll be fun. Don't worry about the quality of the videos. Don't worry about <em>likes</em>. Don't read the comments. Just do it for fun.</p>
