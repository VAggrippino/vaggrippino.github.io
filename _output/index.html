<p>To exclude a directory from <code>git diff</code>, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git diff -- . ':!directory_name'
</code></pre>
<p>You can find this exceptionally terse answer at at least a dozen search results, but not a single one offers an explanation. Well, that's not enough info for me...</p>
<p>The "pathspec" is documented under <code>git help gitglossary</code> and is used for many git commands even if their syntax statement shows <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;pathspec&gt;</code> :</p>
<p>https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_pathspec</p>
<p>Here are the important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The double dashes (<code>--</code>) followed by a space means <em>end of command line flags</em>. Without this, git may try to interpret your <em>pathspec</em> as a command line flag.</li>
<li>The dot (<code>.</code>) means the current directory. I don't think this is really necessary.</li>
<li>The colon (<code>:</code>) indicates that the characters which follow it are a "magic signature".</li>
<li>The exclamation mark means "exclude".</li>
<li>The "magic signature" should be terminated by another colon, but that's optional if the pattern begins with a less magical symbol.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to see what had changed in an <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> site, excluding the generated output files. So, here's the command I used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git status -- ':!:_output'
</code></pre>
<p>Note that I needed to terminate the magic signature with another colon because the path I wanted to exclude started with an underscore (<code>_</code>). Without that second colon, I got an error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fatal: Unimplemented pathspec magic '_' in ':!_output'`</p>
</blockquote>
