<p>I’m losing my momentum. That <em>new project</em> enthusiasm is gone and I’m faced with distraction and doubt. What do I do? Choose an easier alternative? Prepare more before continuing? Or push forward at a unique and considerable risk?</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">The greatest barrier to my employment right now is the lack of a good portfolio. With this in mind, I put together a list of projects to build that I think will demonstrate the full range of my skills… Copies of existing sites with unique modifications… Re-creations of old sites with my own perspective on how they should be built today… And, some original ideas. These are all high-quality, broadly scoped projects targeting real use cases. They are *not* quick one or two day jobs.
<p>About three weeks ago, I chose one from the list and started work. Now I’m at a critical stage. There are, of course, implementation challenges, but that was expected. The problem is that it’s not a new project any more. I’m fixing bugs more than I’m adding features and I’m caught under the avalanche of minutiae of making it <em>just right</em>. It has become a grind: <em>feature… bug… bug… bug… feature… bug… bug…</em> and so on. I’m tired. I don’t look forward to working on it any more. I find my mind wandering. I’m prone to distraction and doubt. Seemingly on it’s own, My mind is tempting me with alternatives… <em>Maybe I should work on my résumé instead.</em> … <em>Maybe I should work on my blog instead.</em> … <em>Maybe I should do some Upwork projects instead.</em> … <em>Maybe I should read more about creating a portfolio first.</em> …</p>
<p><em>This</em> is a critical time. I know all too well that this happens in any project that takes more than a couple of days to finish.</p>
<p>Admittedly, my mental stamina is quite low. It’s my own fault, but at the same time I feel like it was completely out of my control.</p>
<p>For several years after I got out of the Army, I coasted. I did quite well for myself. I had no focus at all, but I had endless energy and boundless enthusiasm. Then I got sick. My energy disappeared and my enthusiasm turned to fear. My constant worry that I would trigger another <em>episode</em> taught me to <em>back off</em> whenever I felt stress. I got very good at <em>backing off</em> and lost the ability to <em>follow through</em>.</p>
<p>Then, my daughter started speaking and dreaming and wanting things beyond simple candy and toys. She has dreams and goals of her own now. What kind of example do I set if I stop working whenever my initial enthusiasm wears off. What kind of parent am I if I don’t earn an income to provide her with a decent education or an environment where her imagination can flourish and she can achieve her goals?</p>
<p>No! I will not <em>back off</em>! This is the mental equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_to_failure">muscle failure</a> and I must push in order to grow. This is an essential trial and I must not fail if I want to … be a person again.</p>
