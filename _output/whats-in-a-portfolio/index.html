<p class="post__date">25o April 2018 - Wednesday</p>
<p>What am I supposed to put in my portfolio? Ideally, I’d have several projects that I built while learning as well as links to past employers’ websites that I contributed to. I should also have some testimonials from people I’ve worked with in the past, but I don’t have any of this.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">My professional history is too far in the past. My previous employers have either been bought / merged / closed or have moved far past my contributions.
<p>What I do have is over 175 <em>pens</em> <a href="https://codepen.io/VAggrippino/">at CodePen.io</a>, 27 repositories <a href="https://github.com/VAggrippino">at GitHub</a>, and 17 "projects" I completed for freeCodeCamp. None of this is professional-quality code worthy of a portfolio.</p>
<p>In short, everything I’ve ever done to show my skills or experience is either gone or an embarassment, and that makes it difficult to actively look for work right now.</p>
<p>This is very disheartening… I’ve been working with computers professionally since 1990 and focused on Web Development since 2001, but I’ve got nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>Nothing right now, at least…</p>
<p>To quote the mantra of the excellent <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show podcast</a> "Just Build Websites!" In that vein, I’ve got some ideas for sites to build for the sole purpose of putting them in my portfolio. My first portfolio project, <a href="https://github.com/VAggrippino/findIt">a search engine</a>, is in progress.</p>
