    <blockquote class="intro__poem">To each his suff'rings: all are men,
        Condemn'd alike to groan,
        The tender for another's pain;
        Th' unfeeling for his own.
        Yet ah! why should they know their fate?
        Since sorrow never comes too late,
        And happiness too swiftly flies.
        Thought would destroy their paradise.
        No more; where ignorance is bliss,
        'Tis folly to be wise.</blockquote>
