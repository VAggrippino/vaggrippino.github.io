    Millions of people are creating Roblox games. Is this the start of a programming career?

            <p>A teenage boy works on his new Roblox game... Is this the beginning of a programming career?</p>
        </figcaption></figure>
<p>I recently overheard a conversation between a Roblox Game Developer and some of his testers. As he demonstrated his game, he identified bugs, things that weren't actually bugs (features ðŸ˜…), and characteristics of the environment.</p>
<p>What got my attention was his concern when he found a bug, relief when it wasn't a bug, and excitement about not only what he had already done, but also what he plans to do in the future... Just like me when I discover a new programming language, API, or framework.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've had the good fortune to participate in conversations with people working in every facet of the Software Engineering industry. Some of them would laugh me outta the room for even posing the question. They might say that you need logic, control flow, a well-documented API, or some other arbitrary and highly-opinionated features in order to be considered <em>programming</em>. I won't debate the point, but Roblox Game Development (along with <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau">Luau</a>) <em>might</em> still qualify.</p>
<p>Programming gives me the opportunity to continuously learn, take what I've learned and make something new with it, break it, fix it, and share it with others before learning the next new thing. That's what I love about it. There's much less <em>rinse &amp; repeat</em> than in other professions. That's what makes it awesome it seems to me that Roblox has this quality in spades.</p>
